	abstract = {This paper examines the political economy of Estonian trade policy in the 1990s. Estonia is a unique case in the world economy, in that the country rapidly implemented unilateral free trade after regaining independence and sustained it right through the 1990s. We analyse the circumstances, interests, ideas and institutions that have shaped Estonian trade policy during the past decade. Our stress is on institutions, particularly the national decision-making setting for trade policy. Through this prism we try to understand how a free trade regime was implemented and sustained, and what this experience suggests for the feasibility of tree trade elsewhere. We also look at the increasingly ‘multi-track’ nature of Estonian trade policy through bilateral free trade agreements, WTO accession and, especially, the movement towards EU accession. Although the other trade policy tracks to some extent provide a lockin for unilateral reforms, we argue that EU accession is undermining the simple, classical liberal trade policy regime that existed during the 1990s.},

This study traces the remarkable reforms that have propelled Estonia from the USSR to the threshold of the EU in less than a decade. The work also explores the tensions inherent in the concept of a postcommunist 'return to Europe'. Since 1991, membership of western transnational organizations has been consistently portrayed as the best guarantee of Estonia's independence. Yet the membership criteria imposed by these organizations have frequently confllicted with the nationalist priority of restoring a sovereign Estonian nation-state. At the same time, Estonia's geopolitically-sensitive location poses a dilemma for the West, thereby ensuring that the country will remain the 'litmus test' - not just of Russia's intentions towards Europe, but of the 'New Europe' as a whole.},

Results support the assumptions that gravity forces and “persistence effects” matter. With respect to the effect of free trade agreements, evidence is found that Free trade agreements between EU countries and CEECs matter. However there is also evidence that the presence of intra-periphery agreements helped expand intra-periphery trade and limit the emergence of a “hub-andspoke” relationship between CEECs and EU. This results have important policy implications for the trade strategy of “future” EU members of the Southeastern European Countries as well as of the Southern Mediterranean Countries. According to the empirical results these countries should move towards a regional free-trade area as exemplified by the CEFTA and the BAFTA to avoid “hub-and-spoke” effects.},

Among transition economies, Estonia first introduced a currency board in 1992, followed by Lithuania in 1994 and Bulgaria in 1997. Currency boards have been useful in achieving macroeconomic stabilisation, and they may have helped the Baltics become the first countries of the former Soviet Union (FSU) to achieve economic growth after the slump in production of the early 1990s. Moreover, Baltic inflation performance has been substantially better than in other FSU countries. Both in Estonia and Lithuania the present exchange rate system has been accompanied by strong real appreciation of the currency, although it is widely accepted that the currencies were very much undervalued when they were initially pegged. However, if rapid real appreciation is accompanied by increases in labour productivity, the present pegs can be maintained. Banking crises in Estonia and Lithuania have not been particularly severe, so apparently rigid currency pegs have not been accompanied by excessive financial sector instability. The tight fiscal policies pursued in both countries, especially Estonia, have been instrumental to the success of these currency board arrangements.},

While free trade agreements strongly increase import competition in the European Union market, their effect on European exports is much more complex. Economic Integration Agreements enhance trade by more product differentiation (the extensive margin), but reduce the trade intensity (the intensive margin) simultaneously. Nevertheless, the cumulative effect over time is positive for imports, as well as exports. Moreover, the trade effects differ across European Union member states and across agreements. In particular, the integration depth and the economic rationale matter.},

The partially time-varying character of our multilateral resistance variables overcomes the bias present in earlier studies that solely rely on country or country pair fixed effects. Applying the augmented gravity equation to the process of European Union (EU) integration during the 1990s, we find robust evidence that the Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) with the Central and Eastern European Countries (CEECs) have substantially increased intra-group trade, in the case of the Czech and Slovak Republic and Slovenia at the expense of the Rest of the World (ROW). Since decreasing multilateral trade resistance negatively influences a country's bilateral imports but may be positively correlated with a bilateral FTA, earlier East–West studies, which ignored the relative price term's time-varying character, tend to be downward biased. Indeed, our results indicate that once we correct for the omitted variable bias, the FTAs with the CEECs created 7 to 20\% more new trade compared with the scenario where only time-invariant country pair effects were included.},

	abstract = {The purpose of the paper is to analyse the impact of EU-accession on the Estonian food sector from the point of view of potential changes in foreign trade. Estonia has followed radical macroeconomic reforms in the 1990's and is well known by its extremely liberal trade policy including the complete absence of tariffs and quantitative restrictions. Therefore the accession to the EU means for Estonia radical change in the trade policy regime. The most affected will be trade with food products and eventually this will cause deep changes in the Estonian agriculture. Estonia has to implement EU common external tariffs against third countries and on the other hand EU food market will be opened to Estonian exporters. In addition Estonia has to implement against third countries the whole system of non-tariff trade barriers required by EU (export subsidies, tariff quotas, sanitary requirements and etc). In general the analysis presented in this paper tries to quantify the effects of trade liberalisation from EU side and growing protectionism against third countries on the Estonian trade with food products. Due to a low prices and protection level at present, many food prices are expected to rise. However, this rise in prices and the consequent increase in production and export depend on the competitiveness of in Estonian products on the markets in the present EU member states. Since January 2000 Estonia already implemented limited tariffs on food products against third countries. Implementation of partial equilibrium analyses allowed to show that trade diversion has taken place as a result of it - the import from third countries has been partly driven out by the import from the European Union and the countries Estonia has free trade agreements with. In the case of some agricultural products it can be supposed that the price increase in imports has also influenced Estonian producer and retail prices. In using of partial equilibrium model the agricultural sector is disaggregated into the dairy, meat and cereals markets. This allows incorporate into the analysis the specific characteristics of different products.},

	abstract = {One of the best-established empirical results in international economics is that bilateral trade decreases with distance. Although well known, this result has not been systematically analyzed before. We examine 1,467 distance effects estimated in 103 papers. Information collected on each estimate allows us to test hypotheses about the causes of variation in the estimates. Our most interesting finding is that the estimated negative impact of distance on trade rose around the middle of the century and has remained persistently high since then. This result holds even after controlling for many important differences in samples and methods.},

	abstract = {For over 40 years, the gravity equation has been a workhorse for cross-country empirical analyses of international trade flows and — in particular — the effects of free trade agreements (FTAs) on trade flows. However, the gravity equation is subject to the same econometric critique as earlier cross-industry studies of U.S. tariff and nontariff barriers and U.S. multilateral imports: trade policy is not an exogenous variable. We address econometrically the endogeneity of FTAs. Although instrumental-variable and control-function approaches do not adjust for endogeneity well, a panel approach does. Accounting econometrically for the FTA variable's endogeneity yields striking empirical results: the effect of FTAs on trade flows is quintupled. We find that, on average, an FTA approximately doubles two members' bilateral trade after 10 years.},

This necessarily involves a careful consideration of the theoretical underpinnings since it has become clear that naive approaches to estimation lead to biased and frequently misinterpreted results. There are now several theory-consistent estimation methods and we argue against sole reliance on any one method and instead advocate a toolkit approach. One estimator may be preferred for certain types of data or research questions but more often the methods should be used in concert to establish robustness. In recent years, estimation has become just a first step before a deeper analysis of the implications of the results, notably in terms of welfare. We try to facilitate diffusion of best-practice methods by illustrating their application in a step-by-step cookbook mode of exposition.},

However, for large samples, computational issues associated with the three-way (exporter-time, importer-time, and country pair) fixed effects currently recommended in the gravity literature have heretofore limited the choice of estimator, leaving an important methodological gap. To address this gap, we introduce an iterative poisson pseudo-maximum likelihood (PPML) estimation procedure that facilitates the inclusion of these fixed effects for large data sets and also allows for correlated errors across countries and time. When applied to a comprehensive sample with more than 200 countries trading over 65 years, these innovations flip the conclusions of an otherwise rigorously specified linear model. Most importantly, our estimates for both the overall CU effect and the Euro effect specifically are economically small and statistically insignificant. We also document that linear and PPML estimates of the Euro effect increasingly diverge as the sample size grows.},

Our criticism of conventional practices and the proposed solution extend to a broad range of applications where log-linearized equations are estimated. We develop the argument using one particular illustration, the gravity equation for trade.

Also not surprisingly, to estimate the effects of RTAs, most researchers and policy analysts have relied on the workhorse model of trade—the gravity equation. Over the past 60 years, there have been many important developments in the RTA literature, both in terms of better methods to quantify their effects, and also in terms of more and higher quality data. The objective of this paper is to trace the evolution of the methods and data developments in the RTA literature, from Tinbergen’s very first exploration until today, and to critically evaluate their significance for our ability to measure the impact of RTAs (and other policies) on international trade.},

It is argued, that although a very complicated privatisation scheme has been created, the process has continued in Estonia during the period 1990-1995 without major setbacks. The private sector has achieved a dominant role in the economy, due in part to privatisation and the emergence of a set of new private firms.},

This paper traces the beginnings of EU–Baltic cooperation and examines factors that led to growing political and economic convergence. Nordic membership in the EU, ex-Soviet troop withdrawal, and Russian parliamentary elections were instrumental in bringing both sides together on the road to enlargement, but collective guilt provided the underlying rationale. In this paper, the author argues that it is impossible to understand fully this process of convergence without taking into account the connotations and consequences of the “black trinity”: the Munich pact, the Molotov-Ribbentrop pact, and the Yalta agreement.},
